# ðŸ§  TypeScript Learning & Practice Repository

Welcome to the **TypeScript Learning & Practice Repo**! This repository documents my journey learning TypeScript â€” from core concepts to real-world application through practical exercises and a final hands-on project.

- Training plan: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nR4C7YU7cbIhpFqYPLU3t04LqaSVgOppCk7M_bi_yys/edit?tab=t.0)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master TypeScript syntax and features.
- Solve practical exercises to reinforce each concept.
- Build a complete practice project applying what I've learned.
- Keep track of key lessons, common mistakes, and personal notes.

## ðŸ“Œ Status

This repo is currently in the **Learning Phase**, which includes:

- Exploring basic and advanced TypeScript features.
- Writing sample code for various topics (types, functions, classes, modules, generics, etc.).
- Reviewing TypeScript behavior in real execution environments (Node.js).
- Documenting insights, patterns, and best practices.

After this phase, I will transition to the **Practice Phase**, where Iâ€™ll:

- Apply learned knowledge to a real project.
- Use TypeScript to implement a modular and maintainable solution.
- Apply best practices and advanced features (e.g., generics, utility types, decorators).
